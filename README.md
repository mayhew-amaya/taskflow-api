TaskFlow is a backend task management API built to practice RESTful service design, data persistence, and service reliability concepts. The project focuses on end-to-end ownership of a backend service, including request validation, database integration, and lifecycle operations such as creation, updates, and deletion of resources.
The API is implemented using FastAPI and backed by SQLite, with interactive documentation and testing provided through Swagger UI.

Tech Stack:
Backend: FastAPI (Python)
Database: SQLite
ORM: SQLAlchemy
API Documentation: Swagger (OpenAPI)
CI/CD: GitHub Actions

Project Goals:
Design and implement a clean RESTful backend API
Practice data modeling and persistence using SQLite
Handle request validation, error handling, and status updates
Gain experience with backend service lifecycle management
